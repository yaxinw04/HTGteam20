Hack the Globe 2023 Technical submission 

Medi+Fill is our technical submission for Hack the Globe 2023. It is a web-extension that helps low health literate individuals navigate medical forms.
It has an auto-fill feature which works with the website: https://www.mskcentre.ca/patient/
In addition, it has a medical jargon translation feature that highlights complex medical terms and when you hover over the highlighted term, a pop-up shows up with a simplified English definition of the jargon term. It also has a read-a-loud feature in the pop-up where by clicking the speaker icon, Medi+Fill utilizes the Speech Synthesis Utterance API to have the extension read out the definition.
